## Data Source

Raw data is sourced from the DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset on Kaggle.

Due to licensing and size constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.
Users should download the dataset directly from Kaggle and place the raw CSV
into the configured input directory before running the cleanup notebook.

## Execution Order

1. Clean the DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset locally.
2. Run the Colab notebook for model training and synthetic data generation.

Do not reverse this order.
